                    <p>Richard Ugino is a professional actor and singer based in New York City.</p>
                    <p>His work has been seen on stage nationally in venues including the legendary Apollo Theater in
                    New York. He has collaborated with Tony Award-winning and Grammy-nominated artists on
                    new theatrical projects as well as established pieces. He has maintained an active career across a
                    variety of entertainment media.</p>
                    <p>Richard made his professional stage debut in Michael Donald Edwards’ production of Amadeus at
                    Syracuse Stage. Shortly thereafter, he was cast in the first national touring company of If This Hat
                    Could Talk—a civil rights movement musical directed and choreographed by Tony winner George
                    Faison (The Wiz.) Following this tour, Richard continued his work with Faison on a new
                    production of West Side Story, performed at the Baltimore Lyric Opera House.</p>
                    <p>He has appeared on the New York stage in productions of Obama 44 (La MaMa e.t.c.), Macbeth
                    and The Taming of the Shrew (CSV Cultural Center), Tartuffe (Theatre Row) and The Caucasian Chalk
                    Circle (45 Bleecker). In addition, he has performed at Birdland Jazz Club, and regularly appears in
                    readings and workshops in New York of new material, both musical and legit.
                    As part of the RIPFEST filmmaking project, Richard performed in “The One That I Want”, a
                    short film directed by Sean Gannet. The film was subsequently shown at the Staten Island Film
                    Festival.</p>
                    <p>His extensive voiceover work includes narration, live announce and audiobook collaborations.
                    He has repeatedly lent his voice to recordings by Full Cast Audio, young adult fiction author
                    Bruce Coville’s audiobook publishing company. His Full Cast appearances include James Howe’s
                    The Misfits and Tamora Pierce’s Circle of Magic series. Richard also recently completed
                    narration for the DVD supplement of the textbook Instrumentation for Audiology and Hearing
                    Science from Plural Publishing, Inc.</p>
                    <p>A graduate of Syracuse University with a BFA in Musical Theatre, Richard performed in
                    numerous productions including Billy Bishop Goes to War—a multi-character solo performance
                    piece with music—which served as his honors thesis from the University. While in the MFA
                    Graduate Acting program at Brooklyn College, Richard appeared in The Thugs (Bart) directed by
                    Welker White, Dancing at Lughnasa (Michael) directed by Mary Beth Easley, and Julius Caesar
                    (Brutus) directed by William Addis.</p>
                    Richard is a proud member of Actors’ Equity Association, the union of professional actors and
                    stage managers in the United States.</p>
